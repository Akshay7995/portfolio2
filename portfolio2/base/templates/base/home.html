                    <hr>
                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate software developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot,
                        Django, and full-stack development. I have a strong foundation in
                        Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), system design, and cloud-based architectures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I’m exploring microservices architecture, multithreading, and concurrent programming,
                        along with enhancing my expertise in Flutter, Dart, and React.js. I thrive on solving complex
                        problems and designing highly scalable applications that make an impact.

                    <hr>
                    <p>I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including Java, Python, MySQL, and HTML,
                        allowing me to tackle a wide range of technical challenges. My expertise extends to popular
                        frameworks such as Spring Boot, and Django, which I have used to develop scalable,
                        efficient applications. In terms of developer tools, I am skilled in using Git and GitHub
                        for version control, Postman for API testing and i am having strong grip in concepts called as
                        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), all of which have equipped
                        me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in software development.

                    <p>
                        My learning journey is shaped by a deep curiosity and a strong passion for technology.
                        I believe in hands-on learning, so I prioritize working on projects and real-world applications
                        to solidify my understanding of concepts. I start by thoroughly exploring foundational resources
                        such as online courses, tutorials, and books to grasp the core principles of new technologies.
                        After that, I dive into practical exercises, experimenting with code and solving problems to gain experience.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Buy Next is an e-commerce web application developed using Spring Boot as the backend framework.
                        The platform allows users to browse a variety of products, add them to a shopping cart, and
                        complete their purchases securely. I implemented user authentication and order management features,
                        while integrating RESTful APIs for product listings and transaction handling. The frontend was built
                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design across mobile platforms.
                        I used H2 for the database, which stores product information, user details,
                        and order history.

                    <p>
                        My Portfolio Website is a dynamic platform built using Django, showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements.
                        It includes section like contact form for visitors to reach out.
                        The backend is powered by Django, with Postgres as the database, storing project descriptions,
                        form submissions. The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site’s content is dynamically
                        managed via Django’s admin interface, allowing me to easily update personal and project details .
